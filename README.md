AIM:

    To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators

SOFTWARE USED:
    
    VS CODE

Theory:

     Decision-making statements in C++ are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. These statements evaluate a condition and execute a block of code based on whether the condition is true or false. 
     
     The main decision-making statements in C++ are:
      1.if statement:Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

      2.if...else statement:Executes one block if the condition is true, and another block if it is false.

      3.else if ladder:Tests multiple conditions sequentially.

     4.nested if statement:An if or else if statement inside another if or else.

    5.switch statement:Allows selection among multiple options based on the value of a variable.

      These decision-making constructs are essential for implementing logic in programs where different actions need to be taken based on different conditions.


Sample output:

               Enter the value of a:
               6
               Enter the value of b:
               9
               Enter the value of c:
               26
               c is the largest number.
               
    Identifying odd or even program-
    
               Enter the number:
               6
               The given number is even number.

    Switch case program-

               Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
               Enter two numbers: 9 10
               9 + 10 = 19 

   Switch case with break statement-

  vowel or constant program-

              Enter a character.
              a
              The given character is a vowel.


Conclusion:

    In this experiment, we successfully studied and implemented various C++ decision-making statements such as if, if-else, else if, nested if, and switch. These constructs enable a program to make logical choices and execute appropriate actions based on user input or program state. Mastery of decision-making statements is crucial for developing real-world applications that require conditional logic and flow control.
