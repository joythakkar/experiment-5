Theory:
Decision-making statements in C++ are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. These statements evaluate a condition and execute a block of code based on whether the condition is true or false. The main decision-making statements in C++ are:
if statement:
Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

if...else statement:
Executes one block if the condition is true, and another block if it is false.

else if ladder:
Tests multiple conditions sequentially.

nested if statement:
An if or else if statement inside another if or else.

switch statement:
Allows selection among multiple options based on the value of a variable.

These decision-making constructs are essential for implementing logic in programs where different actions need to be taken based on different conditions.

Conclusion:

In this experiment, we successfully studied and implemented various C++ decision-making statements such as if, if-else, else if, nested if, and switch. These constructs enable a program to make logical choices and execute appropriate actions based on user input or program state. Mastery of decision-making statements is crucial for developing real-world applications that require conditional logic and flow control.
